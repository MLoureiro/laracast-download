### Laracast download script

This script will download all the laracasts videos into a
folder you specify in the config file.

It still requires an active subscription account!

Yes it is flat PHP, I am a dinosaur. Why do you think
I got a Laracast subscription?

## Usage

Copy the cofig.example.php to config.php, set you options
and account credintials and output directory, then run the
script.

It will attempt to skip movies it already has gotten.

## Requirements

PHP with curl and command line wget

## TODO
