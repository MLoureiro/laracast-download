## Laracasts downloader

This script will download all the laracasts videos into a
folder you specify in the config file.

It still requires an active subscription account.

### Usage

Copy the `config.example.php` to `config.php`, set you options
and account credentials and output directory, then run the
script.

```sh
$ php laracast-download.php
```

### Requirements

PHP with curl and command line curl also

### Warnings

**Use at your own risk**. Jeffery Way has done an amazing job in
all his videos and deserves kudos for his hard work helping
promote Laravel.

He does not endorse this tool in anyway.

I made this tool primarily so that it could download the casts
and put them on my phone. 

As a new member I came in and there were ~~132~~ above **500** videos at the time.
I got sick of downloading them all manually.
