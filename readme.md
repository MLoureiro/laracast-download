## Laracast download script

This script will download all the laracasts videos into a
folder you specify in the config file.

It still requires an active subscription account!

Yes it is flat PHP, I am a dinosaur. Why do you think
I got a Laracast subscription?

### Usage

Copy the cofig.example.php to config.php, set you options
and account credintials and output directory, then run the
script.

It will attempt to skip movies it already has gotten.

### Requirements

PHP with curl and command line wget

### TODO

- ~~Authenicate with Laracast~~
- ~~Get movie lists~~
- ~~Get movie download link~~
- ~~Download~~
- Download only new videos
- Add tag options

### Warnings

**Use at your own risk**. Jeffery Way has done an amazing job in
all his videos and deserves kudos for his hard work helping
promot Laravel.

He does not endorse this tool in anyway.

I made this tool primarly so that it could download the casts
and put them on my phone. 

I have a 16 month old (as of project creation date) and do not
get a lot of time to sit in front of a traditional screen.

As a new member I came in and there were 132 videos at the time.
I got stick of downloading them all manually.
